# Fixtures for offline tests and `--dry-run`

Labels: **REAL** = verbatim fetched content. **RECONSTRUCTED** = every value comes from a live fetch, but the file was re-assembled field by field. **SYNTHETIC** = hand-made in the documented format. Each file says its label in its first line (or `_comment` field).
